# Ocean Governance Account

A review research paper to develop governance accounting within the Ocean Accounts framework. Plan to have interactive visualizations and PDF export capabilities.

## Research Focus

This paper analyses the potential development of a standardised framework of governance accounts in the ocean accounting system.  integration of Ocean Accounts methodology with the BBNJ Agreement's Clearing-House Mechanism (CHM). The research examines technical synergies between existing Ocean Accounts frameworks and CHM implementation requirements:

- **Spatial Architecture**: Three-dimensional geographic reference systems for consistent BBNJ reporting
- **Resource Tracking**: Flow accounting for marine genetic resource utilization chains
- **Impact Assessment**: Environmental baselines supporting comprehensive assessments
- **Conservation Monitoring**: Asset frameworks measuring management effectiveness
- **Capacity Building**: Standardized indicators enabling universal participation

The paper includes technical specifications, implementation pathways, and recommendations based on analysis of treaty text, preparatory documents, and Ocean Accounts technical guidance.

## Technical Implementation

### Document Structure

The research is written in Markdown with Observable Framework extensions, enabling both static HTML and PDF outputs. The main document (`src/BBNJ-CHM.md`) contains the full 5000-word analysis with 73 references.

### Interactive Visualizations

A D3.js Sankey diagram visualizes relationships between Ocean Accounts components and CHM functions:

```javascript
// Import and use the Sankey diagram component
import {createSankeyDiagram} from "./components/sankey-diagram.js";
const diagram = createSankeyDiagram(data);
```

### PDF Export & Professional Typesetting

Generate publication-ready PDFs with sophisticated typesetting and pagination:

#### Intelligent Pagination
- **Smart table breaks**: Automatically detects table size during rendering
  - Small tables (≤6 rows) are kept together on a single page
  - Large tables flow naturally across pages with rows never splitting mid-content
  - Table headers repeat on continuation pages for readability
- **Heading placement**: Prevents orphaned headings using CSS page-break controls
  - Headings stay with their following content (minimum 3 lines)
  - Section headings (h3) specifically protected from appearing alone at page bottom
- **Content flow optimization**: 
  - Paragraphs use orphan/widow controls (minimum 2 lines)
  - Block quotes and code blocks kept intact where possible
  - Figures and captions stay together

#### Academic Formatting
- **Professional layout**: Academic journal style with consistent 15% left margin
- **Hierarchical indentation**: 
  - Body text, headings, and lists aligned at 15% left margin
  - Footnotes properly indented with hanging indent for numbers
  - Nested lists maintain proper visual hierarchy
- **Dynamic footer**: Right-aligned page numbers with render date ("Page 2 of 20. Updated: January 8, 2025")
- **Typography**: Lexend font throughout with Semibold 600 for emphasis
- **Table styling**: Crisp 0.5px black borders for professional appearance

#### QR Code Integration
- **Automatic generation**: QR codes added to first page of each PDF document
- **GitHub repository link**: All QR codes link to the main project landing page
- **Ocean-themed design**: High-contrast dark ocean blue (#003355) on white background
- **Clickable functionality**: QR codes are embedded as hyperlinks for digital PDF viewing
- **Positioning**: Placed in left margin (2mm from edge) for non-intrusive placement
- **SVG format**: Vector-based QR codes for crisp rendering at any zoom level

#### Technical Implementation
- **Automatic detection**: JavaScript pre-processes tables to add size-based classes
- **CSS page rules**: Uses `@page`, `page-break-inside`, and `page-break-after` for precise control
- **Preserved visualizations**: D3.js Sankey diagrams rendered as vector graphics in PDF
- **QR code generation**: Uses qrcode npm package for reliable in-repository generation
- **Clean output**: All Observable UI elements removed, pure content focus

### Data Architecture

Ocean Accounts components mapped to CHM requirements:
- Basic Spatial Units → Geographic reporting
- Flow Accounts → MGR benefit-sharing
- Condition Accounts → Environmental baselines
- Asset Accounts → Conservation effectiveness
- Governance Accounts → Institutional coordination
