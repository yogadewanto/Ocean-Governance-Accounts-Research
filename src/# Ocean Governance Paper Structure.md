### Subsections and research questions 
#### 2.1 Conceptualizing Ocean Governance: Dimensions and Definitions

Polycentric governance arrangements (Ostrom's framework applied to ocean systems)
Sectoral vs. integrated approaches to marine spatial governance

#### 2.2 The Evolution of Accounting Frameworks Beyond Economics
##### 2.2.1 Natural Capital Accounting for the Ocean (Ocean Accounting) 

Ocean Accounting: Architecture and Principles
Standardization principles: consistency, comparability, temporal tracking
Ocean Accounts Partnership and national implementations

##### 2.2.2 Governance Measurement Initiatives: Achievements and Limitations

Review ranges of governance measurement frameworks, and critically analyse their limitations 
Worldwide Governance Indicators (World Bank): aggregated national metrics
Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme governance indicators
Large Marine Ecosystem governance assessments
Critique: lack of standardized classifications, temporal consistency, marine-specific frameworks

##### 2.3 The Governance-Accounting Nexus: Conceptual Integration
Compatibility between governance theory and accounting frameworks
Precedents: institutional accounts within SNA (government sector accounts)
Theoretical justification for governance accounts as complement to natural capital accounts

## 3. METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK: DESIGNING OCEAN GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS (1000-1200 words)
#### 3.1 Principles and Design Criteria
Adaptation of accounting principles to governance context
Criteria: comprehensiveness, consistency, coherence, comparability
Balancing standardization with context-specificity

#### 3.2 Structural Architecture: Classification System **(this is the concept of establishing governance baseline)

##### 3.2.1 Governance Institutions Inventory (baseline)
Typology: legislative, executive, judicial institutions
Jurisdictional levels: supranational, national, subnational, customary
Sectoral domains: fisheries, conservation, maritime transport, coastal development, mining
Cross-classification matrix structure

###### 3.2.2 Governance Processes Classification
Decision-making procedures and participation mechanisms
Planning instruments (marine spatial plans, integrated coastal zone management)
Regulatory instruments (permits, licenses, enforcement mechanisms)
Temporal frequency and review cycles

###### 3.2.3 Governance Performance Metrics

Input indicators: financial resources, human capacity, technical infrastructure
Process indicators: transparency, participation, coordination effectiveness
Output indicators: policy adoption, regulatory coverage, enforcement actions
Outcome indicators: compliance rates, ecological outcomes (when attributable)

3.3 Temporal Tracking Mechanisms

Baseline establishment and periodic assessment cycles
Change attribution protocols: reform-driven vs. organic evolution
Integration with existing environmental state-of-the-ocean reporting

3.4 Data Requirements and Collection Protocols

Primary sources: legislative databases, institutional mandates, budget documents
Secondary sources: policy documents, assessment reports, stakeholder consultations
Quality assurance and verification procedures

Research Questions for Section 3:

RQ3.1: Which accounting principles from SNA and SEEA frameworks are transferable to governance contexts, and which require substantive adaptation?
RQ3.2: What level of classification granularity optimizes comprehensiveness whilst maintaining practical feasibility for implementation?
RQ3.3: How can subjective elements of governance quality be operationalized into reliable, reproducible metrics?
RQ3.4: What data availability constraints exist across different jurisdictional contexts, and how can frameworks accommodate heterogeneous data landscapes?
